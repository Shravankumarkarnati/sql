0) Abstract 
	- What the paper is about?
	- Our approach in writing this paper. 

1) Introduction
	- What are SQL & NoSQL databases? 
	- Just brief intro.
	- Examples of respective databases
	- Just a bit about structure, features and
	  design principles.
	- An image for each db.

	"SQl  - CODD Design"

2) Background
	- Time they were developed.
	- Why they were adopted by large tech 	
	  companies.
	- Most used db in respective category
	  and time/application they got popular.

	"NoSQL - BSON"

3) Properties
	- Detailed Explainations
	- About DB Schemas, type of data 
	  that cann be stored 
	- An image for each 

	"SQL -CRUD,ACID ; NoSQL - CAP"

4) Data Models in NoSQL
	- Key-Value DBs ( Redis )
	- Document Store Databases (MongoDb/CouchBase)
	- Wide Column Stores (Cassandra/DynamoDb)
	- Graph Stores (Neo4j/Redis Graph)

	- An image for each, if possible

	"Evalution of parameters for Each kind of database"

	-------------"Table???"----------------

5) Features in Databases RDBMS/NoSQL
	- Same feature matter but a bit detailed

6) Comparison of RDBMS and NoSQL
	- Comparision of two specific dbs
	- Query Processing

	-------------"Tables???"----------------

7) Essential Security Features in Databases
	- Security Features discussing
	- Some specific issues in mongo

	-------------"Table???"----------------

8) Indexing Techniques in NoSQL
	- Tree Indexing 
	- B Trees
	- AVL 
	- O2

9) Case Study
	- comparison between SQL database management system and No SQL 
	- Oracle Db and Mongo Db
	- as seen from a user point of view 
		--system requirements, 
		-- os you can install them on
		-- syntax differences
		-- drivers to performance differences in query time
		-- insert time and update time on an identical test database

	" Change Queries?? -- 
	  No much difference in changing"

10) Tradeoffs
	-- Scenarios in which sql/nosql is preferred 
		over the other.

11) Conclusion
	-- What database to decide? 
	-- Decision Tree to help decide based on
		requirements and application.
